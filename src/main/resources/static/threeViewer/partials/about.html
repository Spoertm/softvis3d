        <p>Software systems are complex, intangible structures, which are hard to understand. Therefore, visualization
            of software properties, structure and dependencies in different views play an important role within the
            lifecycle of a software system. SoftVis3D is a tool for 3D visualization of software structures and
            dependencies that can be integrated in the software development process by using SonarQube.</p>
